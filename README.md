# aiffel
All jupyter notebooks in this directory is written for submission to AIFFEL node. 
AIFFEL is deep learning education course by Modulabs, Korea.
I'm taking these course from this summer to 13 Dec.
By the way these notebooks are written in Korean mostly.

__description of sub-directories__

## LMS
Aiffel have many learning nodes takes several hours to several days each. A node comes with description, links, codeblocks, questions about specific subject and submission forms. There several categories; Fundamental, Exploration, Going Deeper(NLP), Going Deeper(CV). I guess base of this system is jupyter notebook. Also LMS support jupyter notebook for project submission. I usually copied lots of code from nodes. By the way, I forgot what LMS stands for.  
 All the notebooks in this directory are submitted or tested notebook of Aiffel nodes.
